# Polynomial Restrictor

A **Polynomial Restrictor** application with a GUI built using **Python (Tkinter)**. It allows users to restrict polynomials over a given field and apply partial assignments.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Polynomial Parsing** â€“ Parses input polynomials into structured terms
- **Field Restriction** â€“ Modulo operation to restrict polynomials over a given field
- **Partial Assignment** â€“ Assigns values to specific variables to simplify expressions
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** â€“ Built with Tkinter for easy user interaction
- **Real-time Calculation** â€“ Instantly updates results on polynomial modification

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python** â€“ Core logic and computations
- **Tkinter** â€“ GUI implementation
